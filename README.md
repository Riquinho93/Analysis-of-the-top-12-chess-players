The game of chess is loved in many countries like Russia, United States, India, China, Ukraine and Poland. Chess is a game that challenges our ability to think and improves our mental ability. Furthermore, it improves our memory and ability to plan, we become more creative and protect against dementia.

Chess pieces have different values, for example, knight and bishop are worth 3 each, rook is worth 5, queen is worth 9 and pawn is worth 1. However, these
values are symbolic may not portray reality as in some positions the knight can be worth more than a rook or a pawn can be worth the same as a queen in case of promotion.


Chess games can be aggressive or positional. The game is aggressive when a player sacrifices a piece or more to get checkmate (goal of the game) or get
materials (pieces) of the opponent, in this case the game is resolved in tactics. Positional play is when the player tries to improve his position in every move, in which case the game involves a lot strategy.
